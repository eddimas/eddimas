## DevOps

In a land full of computers, there was quite a fuss,
The apps were all crashing, and the code was a bust.
People were pulling their hair, they couldn't keep up,
That's when DevOps appeared, like a superhero pup.

With a snap of its fingers, and a flick of its wrist,
DevOps got to work, making everything exist.
The developers wrote code, the testers did their part,
DevOps brought them together, like a work of art.

The bugs were squashed, the apps ran so smooth,
Kubernetes stability, now that was the groove.
No more worrying, no more stress,
With DevOps on your side, you'll feel truly blessed.

So if your computer world is in disarray,
Call on DevOps, it'll save the day.
Your apps will run, your code will shine,
Thanks to DevOps, everything will be just fine.

In the world of computers, DevOps is the key,
Bringing order and stability, with such great glee.
So let's all raise a glass, and give a cheer,
For DevOps, the superhero we hold dear!
